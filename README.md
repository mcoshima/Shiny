##Trophic Network
This app allows users to create a network to visualize predator and prey interactions. It is based off the diet database in Oshima and Leaf 2018 for the northern Gulf of Mexico. 
Users can specify a predator or prey, the diet metric, and at what taxonomic level they want the nodes identified at. The color of the nodes is determined by the taxonomic class.
Those in the same class have the same color. The data is then output into a datatable that contains all of the diet information and all prey at the lowest taxonomic level. They 
can download this table as a .csv file.  

##Mortgage Calculator
This app allows users to specify home loan information and calculates the monthly payments.
